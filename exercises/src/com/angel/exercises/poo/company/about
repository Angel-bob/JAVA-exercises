#Employee - Company

    A company has its own and outsourced employees.
    For each employee, you want to register name, hours
    worked and hourly rate. Outsourced employees
    They also have an additional expense.

    Employee pay corresponds to the hourly rate
    multiplied by the hours worked, with the
    outsourced employees still receive a bonus
    corresponding to 110% of your additional expense.

    Make a program to read data from N employees (N
    provided by the user) and store them in a list. After
    to read all data, show name and payment of each
    employee in the same order in which they were typed.
